### Part 3  ― Vectors and Matrices

**Cores**: vectors, matrix algebra, linear transforms, eigenvalues.

Rigorous treatment of *linear algebra* (vectors, matrices and related things) can be found in:

- [Linear Algebra](https://web.calpoly.edu/~jborzell/Courses/Year%2010-11/Fall%202010/Petersen-Linear_Algebra-Math_306.pdf) by Peter Petersen - Chapters 1, 2.
- [Linear Algebra](http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/#current_version) by Jim Hefferon, *a very complete book*.

However because linear algebra is not always intuitive, especially in high dimensions, these resources are more accessible:

- [Linear Algebra Done Wrong](https://www.math.brown.edu/~treil/papers/LADW/LADW_2017-09-04.pdf)
- [Immersive Linear Algebra](http://immersivemath.com/ila/index.html), *an interactive web-book entirely on linear algebra.*

### Foreword

Two topics that are **not** covered in E700 are ***measure theory*** and ***integration***. By and large these are essential to understand most equations found in probability theory, statistics, macro and micro theory, and many more subfields. If you have a minimum of comfort with things like

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\dpi{100}&space;\LARGE&space;\int_{0}^{&plus;\infty}&space;\frac{1}{\sqrt{2&space;\pi}}&space;\,&space;e^{-x^2}&space;dx" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{80}&space;\LARGE&space;\int_{0}^{&plus;\infty}&space;\frac{1}{\sqrt{2&space;\pi}}&space;\,&space;e^{-x^2}&space;dx" title="\LARGE \int_{0}^{+\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \, e^{-x^2} dx" /></a>

then you should be fine.

However, good resources on these topics are:

- [Understanding Analysis](http://cms.dm.uba.ar/academico/materias/verano2012/taller_de_calculo_avanzado/Libros/Abbott%20-%20Understanding%20Analysis.pdf) by Stephen Abbott - Chapters 6, 7, *for a simple introduction to the Riemann integral*.

- [Principles of Mathematical Analysis](https://notendur.hi.is/vae11/%C3%9Eekking/principles_of_mathematical_analysis_walter_rudin.pdf) by Walter Rudin - Chapters 6, 11.

- [An introduction to measure theory](https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/measure-book1.pdf) by Terence Tao, *one of the great contemporary mathematicians.*
- [A Crash Course on the Lebesgue Integral and Measure Theory](https://www.gold-saucer.org/math/lebesgue/lebesgue.pdf)

Note that when you learn measure theory, you *also* learn *Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration*, which is the bedrock of modern probability theory - a skill you'll use forever!
