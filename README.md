### Introduction to Linear Algebra

* [MIT 18.06 by Gilbert Strang](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/) 
* [Gilbert Strang - Introduction to Linear Algebra (2016, Wellesley-Cambridge Press)](https://github.com/ParikhKadam/Introduction-to-Linear-Algebra-5th-Edition---EE16A/raw/master/Ed%205%2C%20Gilbert%20Strang%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Linear%20Algebra%20(2016%2C%20Wellesley-Cambridge%20Press).pdf) corresponding book to MIT 18.06
* [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) by 3Blue1Brown, for a more intuitive approach to Linear Algebra

### Measury Theory
***measury theory*** is important and very helpful when trying to understand most statistical results

- [Understanding Analysis](http://cms.dm.uba.ar/academico/materias/verano2012/taller_de_calculo_avanzado/Libros/Abbott%20-%20Understanding%20Analysis.pdf) by Stephen Abbott - Chapters 6, 7, 
- [Principles of Mathematical Analysis](https://notendur.hi.is/vae11/%C3%9Eekking/principles_of_mathematical_analysis_walter_rudin.pdf) by Walter Rudin - Chapters 6, 11.

- [An introduction to measure theory](https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/measure-book1.pdf) by Terence Tao *

- [A Crash Course on the Lebesgue Integral and Measure Theory](https://www.gold-saucer.org/math/lebesgue/lebesgue.pdf)

### Software
To apply the models discussed in your Econometrics course we usually use Statistical Software. I will list a variety of Software and additional Packages.

***Open Source Software***
 - [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics
 - [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) is an integrated development environment for R. I recommend to use RStudio since it has a                        great GUI and additional tools e.g. for an easier package management
 - [Julia](https://julialang.org/) is a relatively new **high performance** programming Language. It is a gerneral purpose language aiming for easy useage and high performance.
 - [Python]
